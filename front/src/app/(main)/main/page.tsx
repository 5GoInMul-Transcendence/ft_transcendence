      The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy[a][b] is a comedy science fiction
      franchise created by Douglas Adams. Originally a 1978 radio comedy
      broadcast on BBC Radio 4, it was later adapted to other formats, including
      novels, stage shows, comic books, a 1981 TV series, a 1984 text adventure
      game, and 2005 feature film. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an
      international multimedia phenomenon; the novels are the most widely
      distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages by
      2005.[4][5] The first novel, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1979),
      has been ranked fourth on the BBC's The Big Read poll.[6] The sixth novel,
      And Another Thing..., was written by Eoin Colfer with additional
      unpublished material by Douglas Adams. In 2017, BBC Radio 4 announced a
      40th-anniversary celebration with Dirk Maggs, one of the original
      producers, in charge.[7] The first of six new episodes was broadcast on 8
      March 2018.[8] The broad narrative of Hitchhiker follows the misadventures
      of the last surviving man, Arthur Dent, following the demolition of the
      Earth by a Vogon constructor fleet to make way for a hyperspace bypass.
      Dent is rescued from Earth's destruction by Ford Prefect—a human-like
      alien writer for the eccentric, electronic travel guide The Hitchhiker's
      Guide to the Galaxy—by hitchhiking onto a passing Vogon spacecraft.
      Following his rescue, Dent explores the galaxy with Prefect and encounters
      Trillian, another human who had been taken from Earth (before its
      destruction) by the self-centred President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox
      and the depressed Marvin the Paranoid Android. Certain narrative details
      were changed among the various adaptations. The various versions follow
      the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory, as
      Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation.[12]
      Throughout all versions, the series follows the adventures of Arthur Dent,
      a hapless Englishman, following the destruction of the Earth by the Vogons
      (a race of unpleasant and bureaucratic aliens) to make way for a
      hyperspace bypass. Dent's adventures intersect with several other
      characters: Ford Prefect (an alien and researcher for the eponymous
      guidebook who rescues Dent from Earth's destruction), Zaphod Beeblebrox
      (Ford's eccentric semi-cousin and the Galactic President who has stolen
      the Heart of Gold, a spacecraft equipped with Infinite Improbability
      Drive), the depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android, and Trillian
      (formerly known as Tricia McMillan) who is a woman Arthur once met at a
      party in Islington and who—thanks to Beeblebrox's intervention—is the only
      other human survivor of Earth's destruction. In their travels, Arthur
      comes to learn that the Earth was actually a giant supercomputer, created
      by another supercomputer, Deep Thought. Deep Thought had been built by its
      creators to give the answer to the "Ultimate Question of Life, the
      Universe, and Everything", which, after eons of calculations, was given
      simply as "42". Deep Thought was then instructed to design the Earth
      supercomputer to determine what the Question actually is. The Earth was
      subsequently destroyed by the Vogons moments before its calculations were
      completed, and Arthur becomes the target of the descendants of the Deep
      Thought creators, believing his mind must hold the Question. With his
      friends' help, Arthur escapes and they decide to have lunch at The
      Restaurant at the End of the Universe, before embarking on further
      adventures.The original, first radio series comes from a proposal called
      "The Ends of the Earth": six self-contained episodes, all ending with
      Earth being destroyed in a different way. While writing the first episode,
      Adams realised that he needed someone on the planet who was an alien to
      provide some context, and that this alien needed a reason to be there.
      Adams finally settled on making the alien a roving researcher for a
      "wholly remarkable book" named The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. As
      the first radio episode's writing progressed, the Guide became the centre
      of his story, and he decided to focus the series on it, with the
      destruction of Earth being the only hold-over.[13] Adams claimed that the
      title came from a 1971 incident while he was hitchhiking around Europe as
      a young man with a copy of the Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe book: while
      lying drunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking
      up at the stars, he thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a
      hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy as well. However, he later claimed that
      he had forgotten the incident itself, and only knew of it because he'd
      told the story of it so many times. His friends are quoted as saying that
      Adams mentioned the idea of "hitch-hiking around the galaxy" to them while
      on holiday in Greece in 1973.[14] Adams's fictional Guide is an electronic
      guidebook to the entire universe, originally published by Megadodo
      Publications, one of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor Beta. The
      narrative of the various versions of the story is frequently punctuated
      with excerpts from the Guide. The voice of the Guide (Peter Jones in the
      first two radio series and TV versions, later William Franklyn in the
      third, fourth and fifth radio series, and Stephen Fry in the movie
      version), also provides general narration.
